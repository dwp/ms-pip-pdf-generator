#                        This is because it was causing a failure in the swagger code generation step.
#                        This should have no real impact on the gateway implementation.

  title: DWP PIP Award Gateway -> Citizen Information - Service Award Substitute API
  description: |-
    This endpoint is part of the DWP “Service Award Substitute”, which is an API to allow consumers to retrieve data held by DWP about a citizen.
    The citizen is identified by a GUID, which is provided by the /citizens/match endpoint.

    The /citizen/{guid}/claims endpoint returns active claim and active award associated with a citizen from data present in the source system.
    
    There are certain header fields required in each API call to PIP SAS as detailed below -

    | Attribute (M/O) | Description |
    | ---------| ---------- |
    | `host-name (M)`| The hostname of the end user's workstation/desktop (or calling system for non-user system-to-system initiated calls). |
    | `client-ip-address (M)` | IP address of the end user's workstation/desktop (or calling system for non-user system-to-system initiated calls), or an IP address enabling non-repudiable identification of the source of the request.Note: for IPv4, this will always be a max. of 15 characters. Maximum length of 32 is provided for forward compatibility with IPv6. |
    | `instigating-system (M)` | DWP: Contains a unique "System Code", validated against DWP's master System Catalogue .External: Name of sending external system e.g. an external system or application name.Note: Suggest that the System Catalogue supports a hierarchical structure enabling modelling of nested services, systems & components. |
    | `correlation-id (M)` | An ID created by an orchestrating system and passed to sub-systems to enable tracking of a business transaction across multiple systems. |
    | `Authorization (M)` | AccessToken used to access downstream systems such as Guid To Nino service. |
